            The Respect the Fence campaign was born out of my neighbourhood’s experience of intense adult-to-adult bullying, in Cocagne, New Brunswick.
        <p>
            For over four years now, a family in my neighbourhood are carrying out a bullying campaign against their neighbours in order to force them to move. As soon as the behaviour emerged, my neighbourhood intervened. We installed, on my property, a fence to create a buffer zone between the bullies and their victims. It did not work, and it was vandalized in less than two weeks and several times since.
        <p>
            We also called the authorities for help. We did all that was required of us by authorities, but the results we expected never came, even though some of the bullying was criminal in nature. We came to the disappointing conclusion that people who are being bullied at home only have two options: reply in kind or move.
        <p>
            They say « Good fences make good neighbours ». Mine is a witness to the ruthlessness with which these bullies have been able to destroy their neighbours without ever being brought to account.
        <p>
            In addition to the scars of many incidents of vandalism, my fence is now wearing hundreds of ribbons in support of victims of bullying in my neighbourhood and elsewhere. My fence has a mission: to bring awareness to the issue of bullying in our communities and to bring us all together to find solutions. I am convinced that we can develop better tools, and that it is important to address this problem for the health of our communities. I also know, for having lived it, that awareness can go a long way to better use the tools we already have.
